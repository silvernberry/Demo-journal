{% include alerts/info.html content="This is how you can add your own tooltips or hover texts. You can create a tooltip by using two ## instead of an actual link. For some reason, Markdown links that come directly after a bracket are sometimes invisible within a table. You can avoid this by linking directly to your file (For example insted of ## use README.md##). The goal is to have no click effect on the tooltips. They should only look like a link so that you can more easily find the tooltip." %}
